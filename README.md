## 💡 The Problem & Solution
**60% of civic issues go unreported** simply because the process is too hard, and **75% of citizens** are unsure which department to contact.

**Barre Chords** solves this by creating a unified ecosystem where **Citizens**, **Municipal Staff**, and **Contractors** work together. We use **Gemini AI** to automatically sort complaints and **Gamification** (Tokens = Free Plants) to encourage people to keep their city clean.

### 🔄 How It Works (The Workflow)

| **Step 1: SNAP 📸** | **Step 2: AI SORT 🤖** | **Step 3: RESOLVE 🚜** | **Step 4: REWARD 🌱** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Citizen** takes a photo of a pothole or garbage. GPS is auto-tagged. | **Gemini AI** analyzes the image, assigns priority (High/Med/Low), and routes it to the right department. | **Contractors** bid on the job via the app. Municipal staff approve and track progress. | **Citizen** gets notified of the fix and earns tokens redeemable for free plants. |

## 📱 The Ecosystem: 3-Pillar Approach

Our platform connects three distinct user groups to ensure efficiency and accountability.

### 1. 👥 For Citizens (Reporting & Rewards)
* **📸 Easy Reporting:** Effortless issue submission with photo capture, precise GPS location tagging, and quick descriptions.
* **📍 Transparent Tracking:** Real-time updates (Reported → Assigned → Resolved) so users know their voice is heard.
* **🌱 Civic Rewards (Green Initiative):** Users earn tokens for reporting issues. These tokens are redeemable for **free plants** from government nurseries, fostering environmental impact.

### 2. 🏛️ For Municipal Departments (AI Automation)
* **🤖 AI Dept Allocation:** Uses **Gemini API** to detect issue types (e.g., Sanitation, Public Works) and auto-routes them, removing manual sorting.
* **🔥 Priority Tagging:** Reports are instantly tagged as **High, Medium, or Low** priority based on urgency.
* **📊 Data-Driven Governance:** A centralized dashboard to monitor open tickets and optimize resource allocation.

### 3. 👷 For Contractors (Economic Growth)
* **💼 Opportunity Portal:** Access a curated list of government-approved civic projects requiring rapid resolution.
* **⚡ Streamlined Bidding:** A transparent, efficient process allowing contractors to bid on and get assigned jobs quickly.
* **💰 Economic Empowerment:** Creates a new revenue stream for local businesses and supports the local economy.
