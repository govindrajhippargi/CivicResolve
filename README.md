## 📖 Executive Summary

**Barre Chords** is a comprehensive civic engagement platform designed to bridge the gap between **Citizens**, **Municipal Departments**, and **Local Contractors**. 

Currently, **60% of civic issues go unreported** due to complex procedures. We leverage **AI and Crowdsourcing** to create a unified ecosystem where citizens report issues, AI automatically routes them to the correct department, and contractors can bid to resolve them efficiently. By integrating a unique reward system—**Tokens for Plants**—we foster environmental responsibility while solving urban problems.

## 🏗️ The Ecosystem: Three Pillars

Our solution addresses the needs of three distinct user groups:

### 1. 👥 For Citizens (Reporting & Rewards)
* **📸 Easy Reporting:** Effortless issue submission with photo capture, precise GPS location tagging, and quick descriptions.
* **📍 Transparent Tracking:** Real-time updates and notifications at every stage, from submission to resolution.
* **🌱 Civic Rewards (Green Initiative):** Users earn tokens for reporting issues. These tokens are redeemable for **free plants** from government nurseries, fostering environmental impact and sustained engagement.

### 2. 🏛️ For Municipal Departments (AI Automation)
* **🤖 AI Allocation:** Uses **Gemini API** to detect the issue type (e.g., Pothole, Garbage) and automatically route it to the relevant department (Public Works, Sanitation).
* **🔥 Priority Tagging:** Reports are instantly tagged as **High, Medium, or Low** priority so urgency is recognized immediately.
* **📊 Data-Driven Governance:** A centralized dashboard to monitor open tickets and optimize resource allocation.

### 3. 👷 For Contractors (Economic Growth)
* **💼 Opportunity Portal:** Access a curated list of government-approved civic projects requiring rapid resolution.
* **⚡ Streamlined Bidding:** A transparent, efficient process allowing contractors to bid on and get assigned jobs quickly.
* **💰 Economic Empowerment:** Creates a new revenue stream for local businesses and supports the local economy.
