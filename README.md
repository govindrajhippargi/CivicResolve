## 📖 Executive Summary

[cite_start]**Barre Chords** is a comprehensive civic engagement platform designed to bridge the gap between citizens, municipal departments, and local contractors[cite: 20, 29, 34]. 

[cite_start]By leveraging **AI and Crowdsourcing**, our solution addresses the disconnect where 60% of civic issues go unreported due to complex procedures[cite: 168]. [cite_start]We provide a unified ecosystem where citizens report issues, AI automatically routes them to the correct department, and contractors can bid to resolve them efficiently[cite: 32, 45].
